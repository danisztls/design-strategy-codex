## Overview

In 2018, the Wikimedia Foundation Product team identified [machine augmentation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Product/Perspectives/Augmentation) of human activities on the wikis as a key dependency for realizing the Movement's vision of making the sum of the world's knowledge accessible to all the world's people. This section covers work related to evaluating, debiasing, and developing the algorithms that will make [knowledge equity](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2018-20/Recommendations/Innovate_in_Free_Knowledge) achievable at scale. Algorithms have the potential to make content better and more available across language and cultural boundaries, to make contribution and moderation tasks more efficient, to flag article (un)trustworthiness to the reader, and to provide an overall picture of coverage of knowledge across and within wikis.
