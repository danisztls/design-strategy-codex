The Design Strategy group supports [Product Design](https://design.wikimedia.org/) at the Foundation by providing the qualitative and quantitative studies that allow Product teams to make informed and inspired decisions. From explanations of what people do and want, to evaluations of what they experience, to experiments with new and emerging technologies, the research team answers the most urgent and impactful questions that stand in the way of delivering the [“sum of all knowledge, to all the world’s people, for free, forever”](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2018-20).
