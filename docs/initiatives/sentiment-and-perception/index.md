## Overview

The Wikimedia Foundation Product Design and Strategy team has an ongoing series of studies aimed at understanding how our readers and contributors in different contexts use and perceive the interfaces they engage with - on desktop and mobile platforms. Included here are usability studies for new or improved features as well as more open-ended inquiries aimed at understanding how our users describe their expectations and perceive their experiences around finding content, reading, and contributing on Wikipedia.
