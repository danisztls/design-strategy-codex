## Overview

This initiative focuses on understanding a wide range of social behaviors on the Wikimedia projects and on other digital platforms, with the goal of identifying and amplifying patterns of healthy engagement and of tracking and mitigating socially destructive norms, practices and policies. The studies here include original ethnographic work and quantitative studies as well as literature reviews of prior industry and academic research.
