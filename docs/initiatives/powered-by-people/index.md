## Overview

Unlike many for-profit products, the [twelve wikiprojects](https://www.wikimedia.org/) managed by the Wikimedia Foundation are as much about the people who read, write, support and monitor the creation of content as they are about the technologies that enable these activities. Our contributors work on over [800 projects](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Complete_list_of_Wikimedia_projects) worldwide, nearly 300 of which are different language versions of Wikipedia. This means our product teams need to understand how our readers access and utilize wiki content, what motivates and challenges the people who edit and moderate content, and how that varies across different languages, geographies and social contexts.
