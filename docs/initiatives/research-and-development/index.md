## Overview

The Open Knowledge Movement is a radical act of social innovation. In fact, innovation, experimentation and improvisation have consistently resulted in disruptive and pragmatic solutions to core problems the Movement and the platform have faced from the beginning. As a result, these instincts are already built into our culture, and deeply inform the approach our teams take in addressing day-to-day challenges. But in order to meet [2030 goals](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2017/08/10/wikimedia-2030-draft-strategic-direction/#:~:text=The%20strategic%20direction%20of%20the,in%20many%20shapes%20and%20colors.), Wikimedia must build upon its historical success as an experimental platform and focus more intentionally on the emergent needs, challenges and opportunities that fall outside and beyond the current product roadmap. By clearly identifying strategic questions that frame our path forward it will be possible to develop more innovative program, product and technical interventions - ones that can serve the community of contributors, delight end users and de-risk future product development.
