## Overview

In addition to it's qualitative and experimental work, the Wikimedia Foundation Design Strategy team supports product development through quantitative methods. From tracking key characteristics of the 732 wiki projects worldwide to testing/validating hypotheses about the factors that drive momentum in the Free Knowledge Movement, these sorts of studies use numeric data to provide insights that enable the Product teams to make more informed decisions.
